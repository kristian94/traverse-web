        <div class="article-text">
            Traverse is kind of like a travel scrapbook. 
            As you travel the world, 
            Traverse follows your journey and rewards 
            you as you explore.

            The Achievement System
        </h1>
        <div class="article-text">
            The Achievement System, central to Traverse, 
            is a pretty unique feature. 
            Basically, it rewards you for being <b class="article-accent-01">adventurous</b> 
            and getting the most out of your travels. It 
            nudges you to step slightly off the grid 
            and <b class="article-accent-02">discover</b> things your normally wouldnâ€™t.

        <div class="article-text">
            Traverse, at its core, has a very simple goal: 
            <b class="article-accent-03">to make travelling even better.</b> Travelling and 
            sharing your experiences should be simple.
